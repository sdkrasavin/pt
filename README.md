# python
It's the code of a very simple website blocker project developed on Python. You can block certain websites during your work time to improve your productivity.

How to get start?
You need just to clone this repository and edit the host file location depending on your OS:

$-> git clone https://github.com/sdkrasavin/pt

$-> cd pt

$ pt ->

Then, edit Website_bloker.py and then go to line 4 with variable site_to_block and you can add the sites you would like to block during work time

You should also go to the line no 12 and edit default host depending on your Operating System. By default it's Windows

Please, also to set up the starting working + ending working hours where you would like to be restricted from accessing those websites. To do this go to line last line of our code and edit the hours.

That's all!
Thank you!
